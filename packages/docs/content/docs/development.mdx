# Development

Pre-requisite: you should understand how react works internally. If you don't, please give this [series of articles](https://jser.dev/series/react-source-code-walkthrough) a read.

We use a pnpm monorepo, get started by running:

```shell
pnpm install
# create dev builds
pnpm run dev
# run unit tests
pnpm run test
```

You can ad-hoc test by running `pnpm run dev` in the `/kitchen-sink` directory.

```shell
cd kitchen-sink
pnpm run dev
```

## Misc

We use this project internally in [react-scan](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan), which is deployed with proper safeguards to ensure it's only used in development or error-guarded in production.

While i maintain this specifically for react-scan, those seeking more robust solutions might consider [its-fine](https://github.com/pmndrs/its-fine) for accessing fibers within react using hooks, or [react-devtools-inline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-devtools-inline) for a headful interface.

If you plan to use this project beyond experimentation, please review [react-scan's source code](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan) to understand our safeguarding practices.

The original bippy character is owned and created by [@dairyfreerice](https://www.instagram.com/dairyfreerice). This project is not related to the bippy brand, i just think the character is cute.
