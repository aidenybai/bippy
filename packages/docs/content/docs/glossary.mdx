# Glossary

This page provides definitions for key terms and concepts used in Bippy and React internals.

- **fiber**: a "unit of execution" in react, representing a component or dom element
- **commit**: the process of applying changes to the host tree (e.g. DOM mutations)
- **render**: the process of building the fiber tree by executing component function/classes
- **host tree**: the tree of UI elements that react mutates (e.g. DOM elements)
- **reconciler** (or "renderer"): custom bindings for react, e.g. react-dom, react-native, react-three-fiber, etc to mutate the host tree
- **rendererID**: the id of the reconciler, starting at 1 (can be from multiple reconciler instances)
- **root**: a special `FiberRoot` type that contains the container fiber (the one you pass to `ReactDOM.createRoot`) in the `current` property
- **onCommitFiberRoot**: called when react is ready to commit a fiber root
- **onPostCommitFiberRoot**: called when react has committed a fiber root and effects have run
- **onCommitFiberUnmount**: called when a fiber unmounts
- **FiberRoot**: Special type containing the container fiber passed to `ReactDOM.createRoot`
- **Fiber**: React's internal representation of a component. Has complex tree structure
- **Host Fiber**: A fiber that represents a DOM element or native component
- **Composite Fiber**: A fiber that represents a React component (function or class)
- **instrument(options)**: Primary function to patch React DevTools hook. Enables all other Bippy features
- **getRDTHook()**: Retrieves or installs the React DevTools global hook
- **secure(handlers)**: Wraps handlers in try/catch to prevent errors from crashing the application
- **traverseRenderedFibers(root, callback)**: Walks fiber tree, calling callback only on rendered fibers
- **traverseFiber(fiber, callback)**: Traverses the entire fiber tree, calling callback on every fiber
- **traverseProps(fiber, callback)**: Examines props of a fiber, providing prop name, current and previous values
- **traverseState(fiber, callback)**: Examines state (useState, useReducer) of a fiber
- **traverseContexts(fiber, callback)**: Traverses contexts (useContext) of a fiber
- **getFiberSource(fiber)**: Retrieves source code location of a component
- **RDTHook**: Abbreviation for React DevTools Hook
- **isHostFiber(fiber)**: Determines if fiber represents a DOM element
- **isCompositeFiber(fiber)**: Determines if fiber represents a React component
- **getDisplayName(fiber)**: Returns human-readable name of component
- **getNearestHostFiber(fiber)**: Returns closest host fiber to given fiber
- **FiberSource**: Object containing file name, line number, and column number of component source
- **BIPPY_INSTRUMENTATION_STRING**: Identifier for Bippy's instrumentation in the hook
- **PerformedWork**: Flag indicating fiber performed work during reconciliation
