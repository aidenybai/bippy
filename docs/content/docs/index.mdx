bippy is a toolkit to **hack into react internals**

by default, you cannot access react internals. bippy bypasses this by "pretending" to be react devtools, giving you access to the fiber tree and other internals.

- works outside of react – no react code modification needed
- utility functions that work across modern react (v17-19)
- no prior react source code knowledge required

```jsx
import { onCommitFiberRoot, traverseFiber } from 'bippy';

onCommitFiberRoot((root) => {
  traverseFiber(root.current, (fiber) => {
    // prints every fiber in the current React tree
    console.log('fiber:', fiber);
  });
});
```
