## grants

hey, I'm aiden. i'm the creator of [React Scan](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan) (and other devtools like [Million.js](https://github.com/aidenybai/million)).

you've probably seen react's infamous `React.__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED` export. while you probably shouldn't use it for production, it's a good way to access what lurks under the hood of the public API and see how it works.

traditionally, there hasn't been a ton of devtools (other than the official) and many mini versions. i think we're in a time where we might need to invent new interfaces that are more accessible to humans and AI.

i want to help personally give microgrants ($50-$500) to people who want to explore this. i think this space is incredibly unexplored and it's a great way to learn the internals of React.

this repo is bippy, a tool kit that helps get you started quick (without all the hassle of getting started). you can quickly make a [clone of react-scan](https://github.com/aidenybai/bippy?tab=readme-ov-file#a-mini-react-scan) in a few minutes.

to get started, you should create an issue with your idea https://github.com/aidenybai/bippy/issues and tweet @aidenybai on twitter about it :)
